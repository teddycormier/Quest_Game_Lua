# Quest Game in Lua - Phase 1
A classic navigate through rooms, find the key, and open the door game. This is the first fase in a much longer play through game. Be careful... don't click on the wrong doors!

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
I run my game on VSCode with the application, LOVE2D. You can download the latest version of LOVE2D from the official https://love2d.org/ page. Please be sure to have the IDE (in this case VSCode) and LOVE2D installed before use.

## Installing
To install the game, simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

**Copy code:** git clone https://github.com/teddycormier/quest_game_lua.git <br><br>
After downloading the repository, open a new project in VSCode, navigate to the main window (has to be the main window, otherwise it wont run), use command + L on MacOS and Alt + L on Windows to run the game through the LOVE2D interface.

## Gameplay
Embark on a thrilling adventure in a post-apocalyptic world where zombies roam the land. Your mission is to navigate through the maze of rooms and find the key to unlock the door and escape to safety. But beware, the zombies are lurking in every corner, ready to pounce at any moment. Use your wits, strategy and quick reflexes to dodge and defeat the zombies as you make your way through the rooms in search of the key. The fate of your survival rests in your hands in this pulse-pounding, action-packed game written in Lua.

## Built With
Lua programming language and LOVE2D
